# ‚öõ Awesome World Megaprojects

**A list of projects around the world that mark a technological achievement for civilization.** These projects are long, expensive, and highly complex, usually made possible by multiple institutions or countries working together. 

#### üß† Reality check
We live in the [Information Era](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Information_Era_(Civ6)), and as we transition to the next era of civilization (hey there singularity), it's important to be able to put a spotlight on those milestones that brought us to the future. The leaps in infrastructure, scientific discoveries, technological breakthroughs, etc. 

That's why I decided to make this list and keep tracking the progress of these over time. I also wanted to highlight that this is all happening _right now_, but you might not hear about these projects due to their length or obscurity. If the [news was released once every 50 years](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/12/29/574666409/the-50-year-newspaper), the headlines would sure be different. Plus I love the abstract-ness and meta nature of this stuff. Maybe I'll make a Kanban board for it...anyway let's get started. 

##### üîç Types of projects considered: 
- Construction megaprojects
- Important scientific experiments
- Government programmes
- Mass technology / connectivity initiatives


# The list
(In no particular order)

## [High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/high-luminosity-lhc)

`cern` `particle physics` `standard model` `lhc` `upgrade`
 
HL-HLC is CERN's massive performance upgrade to the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, planned to increase the luminosity by a factor of 10. More collisions = more observations = more experiments = more discoveries in particle physics. 

#### Facts
‚òû Top priority of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. </br>
‚òû Collaboration between 29 institutions in 13 countries </br>
‚òû Will produce ~15 million Higgs bosons per year (5x more than LHC) </br>

Field: **Physics** ‚Ä¢ 
Type: **Particle accelerator** ‚Ä¢ 
Org: **CERN** ‚Ä¢
Project lead: [**Lucio Rossi**](https://home.cern/authors/lucio-rossi) ‚Ä¢ 
Estimated completion: **2027**
